# Cyber_Scrape

## Overview
Cyber_Scrape is a data analytics project that provides insights into time-wasting behaviors on social media. The project involves data cleaning using Python and visualization using Power BI to help understand user engagement patterns, productivity loss, and other critical factors related to social media usage.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Processed raw data using Python to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize formats.
- **Data Analysis**: Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and key insights.
- **Visualization**: Integrated cleaned data with Power BI to create interactive dashboards showcasing social media usage patterns and their impact.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: Used for data preprocessing, cleaning, and analysis. Libraries such as pandas and numpy were used for data manipulation, while seaborn and matplotlib were used for visualization during EDA.
- **Power BI**: Utilized to build interactive dashboards, enabling clear and insightful representation of user behavior patterns, time spent on social media, and its impact on productivity.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for exploratory data analysis and documenting insights in an interactive manner.
